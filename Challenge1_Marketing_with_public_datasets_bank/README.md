The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

# Techniques used
1) Machine Learning 
- Feature selection

  AUC

3) Data visualization
- histogram for data distribution
- heatmap for data correlation
- Tree for visualizing a decision tree

4) ML pipeline

5) Data manipulation
- Transformation of data based on data type (Categorical / numerical data) and sub-types (ordinal / nominal)
